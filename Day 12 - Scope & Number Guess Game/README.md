The aim of today's lesson was to build the guess a number game from scratch without support.

You are shown the basics of what the game should do, how it would look (sort of) and then get on with it.

I decided to break each part out into a separate function.

**header()** - This clears the console and prints the logo. This give a clean look to the console, without the normal scrolling found on the console.  
 **number_generator()** - Generates an integer between 1 and 100  
 **difficulty()** - Gives the user a choice of Easy or Hard, determine the number of available guess attempts  
 **guess_counter()** - Keeps track of the number of attempted guesses. If zero states the user looses  
 **your_guess()** - Determines if the guess is correct, high or low. If the user wins or has to try again.
