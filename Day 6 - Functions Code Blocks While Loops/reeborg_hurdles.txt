# reeborg_hurdles.py
'''
    This is a simple move the robot game where there are a limited number 
    of commands, moving the robot character around a grid, over hurdles.
    The robot can only turn left, therefore to turn right it must turn 
    left three times.
    To prevent repetative code a function is designed to turn right.
    Similarly there are six hurdles, this can also be converted into a 
    function. This hop function, ends on the square after a hurdle and ends 
    by facing reeborg to the next hurdle. As the last command in the hop 
    function does not move reeborg, it remains on the final square, expected 
    as the finish line. This removes the need for a separate function just 
    for the last hurdle. Therefore a For loop can be put in place with a range to
    reuse the hop function the appropriate number of times.
