'''
    This time its not the hurdles but a maze. Following the previous task
    with variable heights. I noted the reeborg went up and down each hurdle.
    IE moved up and down in the grid. This is what I had to remember.

    I worked through this to find a solution getting to a place like the 
    lesson solution, below, but I found that it did work for the standard maps,
    but failed to turn right where the break was in the middle of the corridor.
    I may come back to this, but I shall plough rather than ponder this.
